# Fitspo
**Winter Intensive Project**

## Project Purpose

Fitspo is a site I created to help me organize my closet. I've tried many outfit building/closet organizing sites and apps but they all had one common issue; taking pictures
of every item in my closet was way too tedious. I drew inspiration from what I curently use to solve this issue, Pinterest. Fitspo allows me to gather any image 
online and see how others style pieces. Basically, I can gather pictures, add it to my virtual closet, and style it.
